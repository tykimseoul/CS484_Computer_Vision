% This is a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a markup language for producing 
% documents. Your task is to fill out this document, then to compile 
% it into a PDF document. 
%
% 
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex
%
% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): www.latex-project.org/get/
% - We recommend miktex (https://miktex.org/) for latex engine,
%   and TeXstudio(http://www.texstudio.org/) for latex editor.
%   You should install both programs for editing latex.
%   Or you can use Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) which is 
%   an online latex editor.
%
% If you need help with LaTeX, please come to office hours. 
% Or, there is plenty of help online:

\paragraph{Q1:} We wish to set all pixels that have a brightness of 10 or less to 0, to remove sensor noise. However, our code is slow when run on a database with 1000 grayscale images.

\emph{Image:} \href{grizzlypeakg.png}{grizzlypeakg.png}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
A = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
[m1,n1] = size( A );
for i=1:m1
    for j=1:n1
        if A(i,j) <= 10
            A(i,j) = 0;
        end
    end
end
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q1.1:} How could we speed it up?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A1.1:} We could speed up the code by replacing the for loops with logical indexing. The code could be edited as the following.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
image = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
noise_index=image <= 10;
image(noise_index) = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q1.2:} What factor speedup would we receive over 1000 images? Please measure it.

Ignore file loading; assume all images are equal resolution; don't assume that the time taken for one image $\times1000$ will equal $1000$ image computations, as single short tasks on multitasking computers often take variable time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A1.2:} Ignoring image loading time, the speedup method takes around 3.88 times less time. Original method takes around 16.7s, while the speedup method takes around 4.3 s. The following code measures the improvement of the speedup method.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
image = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
tic;
for x=1:1000
    noise_index=image<=10;
    image(noise_index)=0;
end
t1 = toc;
image = imread('grizzlypeakg.png');
tic;
for x=1:1000
    [m1,n1] = size( image );
    for i=1:m1
        for j=1:n1
            if image(i,j) <= 10
                image(i,j) = 0;
            end
        end
    end
end
t2 = toc;
fprintf('Speedup method: %g s\n', t1)
fprintf('Original method: %g s\n', t2)
fprintf('Improvement: %g times\n', t2/t1)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q1.3:} How might a speeded-up version change for color images? Please measure it.

\emph{Image:} \href{grizzlypeak.jpg}{grizzlypeak.jpg}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A1.3:} For color images, the speedup versinon should include the conversion from color to grayscale image. The edited version is shown below. The speed improvement is around 3.82 times. The speedup method takes around 4.7 s, while the original method takes around 17.9 s.
 \begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
colorImage = imread('grizzlypeak.jpg');
tic;
for x=1:1000
    image=rgb2gray(colorImage);
    noise_index=image<=10;
    image(noise_index)=0;
end
t1 = toc;
tic;
for x=1:1000
    image=rgb2gray(colorImage);
    [m1,n1] = size(image);
    for i=1:m1
        for j=1:n1
            if image(i,j) <= 10
                image(i,j) = 0;
            end
        end
    end
end
t2 = toc;
fprintf('Speedup method: %g s\n', t1)
fprintf('Original method: %g s\n', t2)
fprintf('Improvement: %g times\n', t2/t1)

\paragraph{Q2:} We wish to reduce the brightness of an image but, when trying to visualize the result, all we sees is white with some weird ``corruption'' of color patches.

\emph{Image:} \href{gigi.jpg}{gigi.jpg}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
I = double( imread('gigi.jpg') );
I = I - 20;
imshow( I );
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q2.1:} What is incorrect with this approach? How can it be fixed while maintaining the same amount of brightness reduction?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A2.1:} The image is read as an integer matrix but converted to a double matrix. Therefore the argument I of imshow function is of double matrix type. However, imshow expects that an argument double matrix has elements in the range 0 to 1. Because in the current code matrix I does not contain elements in the range 0 to 1, imshow shows a strange image. There are two solutions for this issue. First, the double conversion can be removed as the following.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
I = imread('gigi.jpg');
I = I - 20;
imshow(I)
\end{lstlisting}
\paragraph{}Otherwise, the amount of brightness reduction can be adjusted. The original amount of 20 is out of 255, so it should be converted to a value out of 1. Also, the double matrix should be divided by 255 to make the elements exist in between 0 and 1.
\begin{lstlisting}[style=Matlab-editor]
I = double(imread('gigi.jpg'))/255;
I = I - 20/255;
imshow(I)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Q2.2:} Where did the original corruption come from? Which specific values in the original image did it represent?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A2.2:} In the original code, values in the range 0-255 are put into a function that expects values in the range 0-1. Therefore, only the values in the range 0-1 are shown. Consequently, only the regions in the original image that have values 0-1 (almost black) are represented.
