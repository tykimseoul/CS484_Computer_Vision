% This is a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a markup language for producing 
% documents. Your task is to fill out this document, then to compile 
% it into a PDF document. 
%
% 
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex
%
% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): www.latex-project.org/get/
% - We recommend latex compiler miktex (https://miktex.org/) for windows,
%   macTex (http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS users.
%   And TeXstudio(http://www.texstudio.org/) for latex editor.
%   You should install both compiler and editor for editing latex.
%   The another option is Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) which is 
%   an online latex editor.
%
% If you need help with LaTeX, please come to office hours. 
% Or, there is plenty of help online:

% Good luck!

	\section*{Questions}
	
	\paragraph{Q1:} Explicitly describe image convolution: the input, the transformation, and the output. Why is it useful for computer vision?

	\paragraph{Q2:} What is the difference between convolution and correlation? Construct a scenario which produces a different output between both operations.
	
	\emph{Please use \href{https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imfilter.html}{$imfilter$} to experiment! Look at the `options' parameter in MATLAB Help to learn how to switch the underlying operation from correlation to convolution.}

	\paragraph{Q3:} What is the difference between a high pass filter and a low pass filter in how they are constructed, and what they do to the image? Please provide example kernels and output images.

	\paragraph{Q4:} How does computation time vary with filter sizes from $3\times3$ to $15\times15$ (for all odd and square sizes), and with image sizes from 0.25~MPix to 8~MPix (choose your own intervals)? Measure both using \href{https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imfilter.html}{$imfilter$} to produce a matrix of values. Use the \href{https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imresize.html}{$imresize$} function to vary the size of an image. Use an appropriate charting function to plot your matrix of results, such as \href{https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/scatter3.html}{$scatter3$} or \href{https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/surf.html}{$surf$}.
	
	Do the results match your expectation given the number of multiply and add operations in convolution?
