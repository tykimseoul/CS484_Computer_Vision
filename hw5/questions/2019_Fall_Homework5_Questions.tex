% This is a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a markup language for producing 
% documents. Your task is to fill out this document, then to compile 
% it into a PDF document. 
%
% 
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex
%
% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): www.latex-project.org/get/
% - We recommend latex compiler miktex (https://miktex.org/) for windows,
%   macTex (http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for macOS users.
%   And TeXstudio(http://www.texstudio.org/) for latex editor.
%   You should install both compiler and editor for editing latex.
%   The another option is Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/) which is 
%   an online latex editor.
%
% If you need help with LaTeX, please come to office hours. 
% Or, there is plenty of help online:

\section*{Questions}

\paragraph{Q1:} Given a linear classifier, how might we handle data that are not linearly separable? How does the \emph{kernel trick} help in these cases? (See course slides in supervised learning, plus your own research.)

\paragraph{Q2:} In machine learning, what are bias and variance? When we evaluate a classifier, what are overfitting and underfitting, and how do these relate to bias and variance?

\paragraph{Q3:} The way that the bag of words representation handles the spatial layout of visual information can be both an advantage and a disadvantage. Describe an example scenario for each of these cases, plus describe a modification or additional algorithm which can overcome the disadvantage. 

How might we evaluate whether bag of words is a good model?
